# RL-Tic-Tac-Toe

A Tabular Q-Learning Reinforcement Learning Project of an agent playing Tic-Tac-Toe.

This was a Python-based project using Tabular Q-learning in order to play Tic-Tac-Toe. 4 iterations of agents were created to play in a 3x3 grid; 2 iterations were created to play a 4x4 grid. Each had different min/max epsilons to affect Exploration/Exploitation strategies.

"Tic-Tac-Toe RL Fitch.pdf" contains the text of the analysis along with the supporting figures and tables. The 6 iterations are uploaded as .py files.
